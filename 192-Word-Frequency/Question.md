# 192. Word Frequency

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-frequency/)

Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file `words.txt`.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:

*   `words.txt` contains only lowercase characters and space `' '` characters.
*   Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
*   Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.

For example, assume that `words.txt` has the following content:

<pre>the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is
</pre>

Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:

<pre>the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1
</pre>

**Note:**  
Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.
